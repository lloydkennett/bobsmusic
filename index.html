              <p>But the girl in every dream was the Co-op dancing queen</p>
              <p>He'll go back home and marry her some day</p>
              <br />
              <p>(Well he)</p>
              <p>Paid off down in old Cape Town, Hit the bars and ran- around</p>
              <p>Time for those Africana girls and sun</p>
              <p>But he dreamed of his dancing queen and all those oceans in between</p>
              <p>(So he) signed on for the North Atlantic run</p>
              <p>Well he knew he was getting closer in Halifax, Novia Scotia</p>
              <p>Close enough to realise his dream</p>
              <p>He problems started when -his ship could just do ten</p>
              <p>The rest of the convoy they we making fifteen.</p>

              <p>In the dog watch late at night that port and starboard lights</p>
              <p>Were disappearing fast across the foam</p>
              <p>But the pole star and the plough stayed over his port bow</p>
              <p>And guided that old sea-dog straight back home</p>
              <p>With his demob suit and pay he gambled all the way</p>
              <p>From Liverpool to Brighton over-night</p>
              <p>So just like in his dream he married his dancing queen</p>
              <p>Both of the families said "well it just aint right"</p>
              <h4>CHORUS</h4>
              <p>Well he did not stand a chance when she taught him how to dance</p>
              <p>They were reeling ,rocking and rolling every day</p>
              <p>Well it was fifty years ago today she stole his heart away hey hey</p>
              <p>And no-one gave them half a chance , no-one gave them half a chance</p>
              <p>And no-one gave them half a chance - NO WAY</p>
              <h4>CHORUS</h4>

        <p class=review-title>RADIO PLAY OF "TELL ME TELL ME TRUE" ON RADIO UK INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p class=review-text>This critical review of Robert Lloyd songs was posted by John D Wilson in October 2010 (on
          the blog website
          Windy Ridge -what it looks like from here)</p>
        <p class=review-text>John D Wilson is a successful singer/songwriter who has had USA Country Chart No1 hit song
          and who has been
          professionally involved in reviewing indie songs in USA - so who am I to argue!</p>
