<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<p>Hear my witness - take the floor</p>
<p>Make your witness Matthew 7:24</p>
<br />
<p>I bear witness to the power of the sea</p>
<p>Even languid rivers hold dominion over me</p>
<p>I bear witness to the folds of the land</p>
<p>Even mighty mountains are crushed to desert sand</p>
<p>I bear witness to the power in the air</p>
<p>Twisting storm and hurricane is more than I can bear</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>I bear witness to the raising of the beast</p>
<p>Feeding on the sins of man his evil was released</p>
<p>I bear witness to the lion with the lamb</p>
<p>Now at peace he stands unleashed and eating from my hand</p>
<p>I bear witness to the never ending plan</p>
<p>Just as my existence is a footprint in the sand</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Take this witness - build your house upon a rock</p>
<p>Mighty storm and flood will come but it will founder not.</p>
<p>Forsake this witness build your house upon the sand</p>
<p>Mighty storm and flood will come and beat it to the ground</p>
<br />
<p>Hear my witness - Take the floor - Make your witness Matthew 7:24</p>
<br />
<p>I bear witness to the power of the WORD</p>
<p>Testify this witness your voices will be heard</p>
<br />
