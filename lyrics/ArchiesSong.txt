     Archie (my Dad ) always threatened to return to his first love "the sea"

    CHORUS:-

    "Three times around the world in thirty different countries"

    A girl in every port or so they say

    But the girl in every dream was the Co-op dancing queen

    He'll go back home and marry her some day

 

    (Well he)

    Paid off down in old Cape Town, Hit the bars and ran- around

    Time for those Africana girls and sun

    But he dreamed of his dancing queen and all those oceans in between

    (So he) signed on for the North Atlantic run

    Well he knew he was getting closer in Halifax, Novia Scotia

    Close enough to realise his dream

    He problems started when -his ship could just do ten

    The rest of the convoy they we making fifteen.

    CHORUS

    In the dog watch late at night that port and starboard lights

    Were disappearing fast across the foam

    But the pole star and the plough stayed over his port bow

    And guided that old sea-dog straight back home

    With his demob suit and pay he gambled all the way

    From Liverpool to Brighton over-night

    So just like in his dream he married his dancing queen

    Both of the families said "well it just aint right"

    CHORUS

    Well he did not stand a chance when she taught him how to dance

    They were reeling ,rocking and rolling every day

    Well it was fifty years ago today she stole his heart away hey hey

    And no-one gave them half a chance , no-one gave them half a chance

    And no-one gave them half a chance - NO WAY

    CHORUS

    fini : and no-one gave them half a chance x 3 - NO WAY!
