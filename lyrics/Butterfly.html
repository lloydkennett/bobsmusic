<h3>Butterfly</h3>
<br />
<p>Should have known I could not change - believing every word</p>
<p>I even gave you space and time - aint that just absurd</p>
<p>Because your love just gave me wings -(I was) flying like a bird</p>
<p>Then falling like a butterfly - in the rain</p>
<p>I need the warmth of your sweet love to dry my wings again</p>
<br />
<p>I should have known you could not change - I still taste those lies</p>
<p>To trust is such a crazy thing while learning to despise</p>
<p>I tell myself - now don't look down, experience the highs</p>
<p>Then falling like a butterfly in the rain</p>
<p>I need the warmth of your sweet love to dry my wings again</p>
<br />
<p>Sometimes it feel we get it right - or so it might have seemed</p>
<p>It only took one drunken night to tear it at the seems</p>
<p>To get that high loke we have done like flying in my dreams</p>
<p>(Then falling like a butterfly -in the rain</p>
<p>I need the warmth of your sweet love</p>
<p>To dry my wings again) x2</p>
