<h3>Monkey Tree</h3>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<p>Hey papa look at me - I'm gonna climb the monkey tree</p>
<p>Watch me climb way to the top - Catch me when I swing and drop</p>
<br />
<p>Football jerseys coloured bright in the early morning light</p>
<p>Pretty girls to bring you home singing of the games you've won</p>
<p>But I don't see you like they do - memories keep coming through</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Wedding garlands coloured bright in the early morning light</p>
<p>Mother all choked up inside - watch you as you kiss the bride</p>
<p>But I dont see you in that way - I remember yes-ter-day</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Uniforms in colours bright - in the early morning light</p>
<p>Family is filled with pride - farewell on the harbourside</p>
<p>But I can't watch you leave us all - wont be there in case you fall</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Welcome home in banners bright - in the early morning light</p>
<p>Tears of joy fill my eyes - children call with welcome cries</p>
<p>But I don't hear a single sound - just these words go round and round </p>
