<h3>Waiting For The Girl</h3>
<br />
<p>She loves me she loves me not - watch me count the petals as they fall</p>
<p>She needs me she needs me not - dont know why I play this game at all</p>
<p>Kicking up the autumn leaves - standing with my back against the wall</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS :-</h4>
<p>Will I be forever - Waiting for the girl</p>
<p>Time can have no meaning - Waiting for the girl</p>
<br />
<p>I love you is what she said - I could only say I love you too</p>
<p>I need you is what we said - wedding vows (bells) today for me an you</p>
<p>Organ (music) plays I turn my head - catch my breath as you come into view</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>(I'm) feeling that little kick - soon we will be three instead of two</p>
<p>(Those) tiny feet go "patter pit" - baby kisses sweet as honey dew</p>
<p>Watch my little angel grow - nothing in the world I wouldn't do</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>She tells me "He's very sweet - better drive her down to her first date</p>
<p>They kiss only on the cheek - honey home by ten now don't be late</p>
<p>Sitting on the front porch steps - hoping I am not just tempting fate</p>
<br />
<p>CHORUS - repeat "waiting for the girl" x 3 to end</p>
