<p>I was the first born - my father's quest - I was to be the only one</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>

<p>My name is Isaac - my eyes look West - my heart is full of evening sun</p>
<p>Born into laughter - I cannot rest - until I am the only one</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>My name is Ishmael my sword an arc is raised against my father's son</p>
<p>I am in wilderness - a noble beast - I will not bow to anyone</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
