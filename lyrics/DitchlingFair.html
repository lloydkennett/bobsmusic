<p>Mayday morning comes around Maypole dancers gather on the lea</p>
<p>Heavens open - catch the sound of the raindrops on the ribbon tree</p>
<p>Breathless running to the barn - Oh how warm and tender love can be</p>
<p>And I plucked the straw fron the hair of the prettiest girl in Ditchling fair (X2)</p>
<p>Harvest morning comes a round - thank the Lord for all the blessings past</p>
<p>Waiting till the sun goes down we can be alone again at last</p>
<p>Making love beneath the stars all my hopes and dreams will be surpassed</p>
<p>(When) I'll pluck the straw from the hair of the prettiest girl in Ditchling fair (X2)</p>
<p>Christmas morning comes around Jack Frost fingers on the window pane</p>
<p>Will you leave the fireside - take a walk and breathe the air again</p>
<p>Wrap up warm now hold my arm - you will never fall when you're with me</p>
<p>And I'll pluck the straw from the hair of the prettiest girl in Ditchling fair</p>

<p>And I'll pluck the straw from the hair of the prettiest girl in Ditchling fair ( X4 to end)</p>
