<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<p>Huckle my buff and hopping John ,shackle with the cook</p>
<p>Will keep you young and make you strong like Rhuban Uptons Crook</p>
<br />
<p>Ruben was a longanner - a lookerer in his slop</p>
<p>Not mallock like the mumper nor tessy like the fop</p>
<p>(Cos) Ruben did his duzzick (and) would never farmers rook</p>
<p>But every man and devil ran from Ruben Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<br />
<p>Now Lord Tom Noddy came from town to do some politic</p>
<p>He beat the devil round the bush so Rhuban upped to speak</p>
<p>Lord Tom set the peelers and while he cut he hook</p>
<p>(But) t'was no libbet beat them down but Rhuban Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<br />
<p>The Bishop came from Chichester to watch the tythe come in</p>
<p>But farmers cheat the parson - for a'stealin is a sin</p>
<p>And as the knave walked down the aisle the congregation shook</p>
<p>'Cos Bishop carried book and bell and Rhuban Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<br />
<p>Old Brown George and Bumble cake ,Sussex pond an' Dick</p>
<p>(Like) Gooding at the doubter's day for sure will make you sick</p>
<p>But huckle my buff and hopping John and shackle with the cook</p>
<p>Will keep you young and make you strong like Rhuban Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<br />
<p>(Now) Ruben was a dabster with draggletails and mawks</p>
<p>You could hear their goistering while on the bostal walks</p>
<p>An' every girl from Wick to Firle would say the tottle shook</p>
<p>Twas not their beau that made it so but Rhuban Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<br />
<p>The goodly folk of Sussex say the poor man is an awk</p>
<p>Who met his end at Poynings bend and druv beneath the chalk</p>
<p>You see the crib at Michelmas - then take a closer look</p>
<p>tis not a sword protects our Lord but Rhuban Upton's Crook</p>
<br />
