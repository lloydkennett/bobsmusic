<h4>CHORUS:-</h4>
<br />
<p>"Three times around the world in thirty different countries"</p>
<p>A girl in every port or so they say</p>
<p>But the girl in every dream was the Co-op dancing queen</p>
<p>He'll go back home and marry her some day</p>
<br />
<p>(Well he)</p>
<p>Paid off down in old Cape Town, Hit the bars and ran- around</p>
<p>Time for those Africana girls and sun</p>
<p>But he dreamed of his dancing queen and all those oceans in between</p>
<p>(So he) signed on for the North Atlantic run</p>
<p>Well he knew he was getting closer in Halifax, Novia Scotia</p>
<p>Close enough to realise his dream</p>
<p>He problems started when -his ship could just do ten</p>
<p>The rest of the convoy they we making fifteen.</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>In the dog watch late at night that port and starboard lights</p>
<p>Were disappearing fast across the foam</p>
<p>But the pole star and the plough stayed over his port bow</p>
<p>And guided that old sea-dog straight back home</p>
<p>With his demob suit and pay he gambled all the way</p>
<p>From Liverpool to Brighton over-night</p>
<p>So just like in his dream he married his dancing queen</p>
<p>Both of the families said "well it just aint right"</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Well he did not stand a chance when she taught him how to dance</p>
<p>They were reeling ,rocking and rolling every day</p>
<p>Well it was fifty years ago today she stole his heart away hey hey</p>
<p>And no-one gave them half a chance , no-one gave them half a chance</p>
<p>And no-one gave them half a chance - NO WAY</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
