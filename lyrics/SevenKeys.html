<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<p>Seven keys are memories that open up my heart</p>
<p>Seven keys are guaranteed to make these tear drops start</p>
<br />
<p>Used to go to the grandfolks house whenever I felt down</p>
<p>That big old house had many rooms my sorrows there to drown</p>
<p>Down behind the kitchen door there hung an old key rack</p>
<p>With seven keys for seven locks and the words "please put me back"</p>
<p>Never had to ask granma if grandpa was around</p>
<p>Just see which key was missing And that's where he'll be found</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>The first key was the garden - Oh God he loved that place</p>
<p>And every time I found him there I saw it in his face</p>
<p>The second key - the workshop where granpa had his fun</p>
<p>Not proud of his achievements Just satisfied it's done.</p>
<p>Third key was the attic den was missing twice a year</p>
<p>Where grandpa kept his memories not proud to show a tear</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Fourth key was the old garage where grandpa kept his toy</p>
<p>A fiftyseven eight pot thunderbird that made an amazing noise</p>
<p>Then when I was seventeen he handed me key five</p>
<p>And said "here son go have some fun and take her for a ride"</p>
<p>The sixth key was the store room full of kilner jars and pans</p>
<p>He called it womens alchemy no place for boy nor man</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Now the seventh key stayed in it's place as far as I recall</p>
<p>I tried that key in every lock with no success at all</p>
<p>In my curiosity I asked what it was for</p>
<p>Grandma only smiled and said "It opens heaven's door"</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Went back to the grandfolks place I never felt so down</p>
<p>No welcome on the doorstep cause no-one was around</p>
<p>And when I looked behind the kitchen door as I had often done</p>
<p>Six of the keys were hanging there but the seventh key was gone</p>
<br />
