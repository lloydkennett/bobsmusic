<h3>Stick Song</h3>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<p>Every stick brings a memory back</p>
<p>Your love and affection are the things that I lack</p>
<br />
<p>I walk on the sand my shoes in my hand - it's late summer</p>
<p>The sun's getting low and starting to throw those long shadows</p>
<p>I get a stick and throw it into the sea</p>
<p>Aint got your dog to fetch it back to me</p>
<p>And people say Bobby don't you like to be free</p>
<p>And people say Bobby aint it good to be free</p>
<p>But I'm lonely</p>
<p>I walk by the stream the air is so clean its a Spring morning</p>
<p>Those far away snows are making the flow like diamonds</p>
<p>I throw a stick and watch it tumble away</p>
<p>Tht's just another silly game we would play</p>
<p>And people say Bobby don't you like it this way</p>
<p>And people say Bobby you must like it this way</p>
<p>But I'm lonely</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>I sweep up the leaves but the leaves on the trees just keep fallin</p>
<p>I make a fire and watch as the pyre keeps burnin</p>
<p>I get use stick to help the fire to rise</p>
<p>It's not the smoke that brings the tears to my eyes</p>
<p>And people say Bobby must be great with no ties</p>
<p>And people say Bobby aint it great with no ties</p>
<p>But I'm lonely</p>
<p>It's twenty below ,my car doesn't go so I'm walkin</p>
<p>The freeway is slow ,the ice and the snow just keeps fallin</p>
<p>I get a stick and throw it out on the lake</p>
<p>I throw another but the ice doesn't break</p>
<p>And people say Bobby just how long will it take</p>
<p>And People say Bobby how long can it take but I'm lonely</p>
<br />
