<h3>Bevin Boy</h3>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS:</h4>
<p>Can anybody tell me where this train is goin'</p>
<p>Can anybody tell me where this iron beast is bound</p>
<p>The preacher on a Sunday said you're bound for glory</p>
<p>The letter on the Monday said you're goin' underground</p>
<br />
<p>Well the ticket in my pocket for a place they call The Rhondda</p>
<p>Someone calls me "conchy" and I have to bow my head</p>
<p>I walk towards the winding wheel my head is filled with thunder</p>
<p>Oh God I wish that letter sent me to France instead</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Well three long years of day is night picking at the seam</p>
<p>Every canch and collier to feed the war machine</p>
<p>No-one calls you hero lest you're carrying a gun</p>
<p>No-one wants a Bevin Boy when the war is done</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
