<h4>CHORUS:</h4>
<p>Here I go with all my heart in every word right from the start</p>
<p>All my love long overdue is in my song of you (hoo hoo)</p>
<p>All the love that's good and true is in my song of you</p>
<br />
<p>I sing my songs in downtown bars and uptown jamborees</p>
<p>Those country songs of long lost love and sweet sweet memories</p>
<p>So many words close to my heart they're just like family</p>
<p>They serve me well but they don't tell just what you mean to me</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>Check-in lones ,Xray machines and long black limousines</p>
<p>Interstates so long and straight -just following my dreams</p>
<p>Everyone is my best friend but when the day is through</p>
<p>All their smiles and stay-a-whiles wont keep me far from you</p>
<br />
<h4>CHORUS</h4>
<br />
<p>The more I smile the more I sing the mor my feelings show</p>
<p>And all the fortune in the world wont make these feelings go</p>
<p>You give me strenght to see me through the dark times and the blues</p>
<p>To let the love come shining through I'll sing my song of you</p>
<br />
