<p>Swallows they fly from miles around just to drink at your pool</p>
<p>Rabbits and moles underground keep ....... for you</p>

<p>So please take your leave of those mean city streets</p>
<p>(and) Please don't be sweet to the men that you meet</p>
<p>My sweet Jane O' Green</p>
<br />
<p>Salmon they climb way up stream - just to swim in your pool</p>
<p>Owls they wake from long day dreams to tell me you're such a fool</p>
<p>Bright lights don't suit you -like candle lights do</p>
<p>So please take your leave of those mean city streets</p>
<p>So please don't be sweet to the men that you meet</p>
<p>My sweet Jane O'Green</p>
<br />
<p>Butterfly wings will cool your head if you promise to stay</p>
<p>Mosses and leaves will make your bed at the end of the day</p>
<p>Bright lights don't suit you my sweet Jane O'Green</p>
<p>So please take your leave of those mean city streets</p>
<p>Please dont be sweet to the men that you meet</p>
